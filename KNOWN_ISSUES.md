# Known issues

Every defect, deferral, and speed miss is recorded here instead of being
silently forgotten or quietly relaxed. Severity rules are in
`plan/rules.md` section 11 and in `AGENTS.md` section 4.

Each entry: ID, severity, the step where it was found, a plain-language
description, any workaround, and the target step or milestone for the fix.
When an issue is fixed, move it to the **Fixed** section with the commit
that fixed it.

## Open

### KI-001 - First-ever run takes about 2.2 seconds (Minor)
- **Found in:** Step 01b. **Severity:** Minor (one-time cost).
- **What:** The very first launch creates the WebView2 profile and takes
  about 2.2 s to show the window on the development PC. The startup
  skeleton (built into the first page) is shown as soon as the window
  paints. Every later start is fast (see KI-002/KI-003).
- **Workaround:** none needed; it happens once.
- **Target:** reviewed at every milestone; no fix planned unless the
  after-reboot measurement (KI-003) shows a wider problem.

### KI-002 - First start after installing or rebuilding takes about 1.6 s to first paint (Minor)
- **Found in:** Step 01b. **Severity:** Minor (one-time cost per install).
- **What:** The first execution of a freshly installed or rebuilt
  executable pays Windows Defender scanning and cold file caches: about
  1.6 s to first paint and 2.4 s until fully ready in the worst measured
  run. Normal cold starts (WebView2 stopped, caches warm) measure 87 ms
  first paint / 699 ms ready, inside the Fast tier.
- **Workaround:** none; start the app once after installing.
- **Target:** reviewed at every milestone.

### KI-003 - Cold start right after a reboot is not yet measured (Major)
- **Found in:** Step 01b. **Severity:** Major until measured (a daily-use
  speed miss cannot be ruled out yet).
- **What:** All cold numbers so far were measured without rebooting the
  PC, so cold operating-system caches after a real reboot are unproven.
- **Workaround / next action:** the owner runs
  `scripts\measure-startup.ps1` right after a reboot; then this entry is
  closed (if inside the Fast tier of 1 s) or kept open with a fix plan.
- **Target:** measurement at the next reboot; any fix before v0.1.

### KI-004 - The app icon is a placeholder (Minor)
- **Found in:** Step 01b. **Severity:** Minor (cosmetic).
- **What:** The window/taskbar icon is a generated solid-blue square
  (`src-tauri/icons/icon.ico`), not a designed Adperastra icon.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Target:** a designed icon before v0.1 (Step 08c release polish at the
  latest).

### KI-005 - Snap-layout flyout not yet confirmed visually by the owner (Minor)
- **Found in:** Step 01b. **Severity:** Minor (until confirmed).
- **What:** The custom maximize button now reports `HTMAXBUTTON` to
  Windows (verified by message test), so the Windows 11 snap-layouts
  flyout should appear on hover - but the owner has not yet seen it with
  their own eyes.
- **Workaround:** window snapping still works with Win+arrow keys and by
  dragging the title bar to a screen edge.
- **Target:** owner confirmation in normal use; if the flyout does not
  appear, this becomes a Step 02 fix.

### KI-009 - A pinned folder renamed or deleted outside the app stays stale in the nav pane (Minor)
- **Found in:** Step 02. **Severity:** Minor (rare edge case).
- **What:** The open folder and This PC update live (watch + drive polling), but a pinned folder itself being renamed or deleted in another app is not noticed; the nav pane keeps the old entry until you unpin it or restart. Clicking it shows "This folder could not be opened."
- **Workaround:** unpin the stale entry (open it fails, so use the unpin button next to it) and pin the renamed folder; or restart the app.
- **Target:** Step 07a background refresh (the metadata service can verify pinned paths then).

### KI-013 - Hidden and system files are always shown (Minor)
- **Found in:** Step 02 (final review). **Severity:** Minor.
- **What:** Hidden items are dimmed but always visible; there is no user setting yet (the settings schema predates Explorer options).
- **Target:** Step 10b folder customization settings.

## Fixed

### KI-010 - Explorer-state save was not fully atomic and reads were unlocked (fixed in Step 02)
When the first rename failed, the writer deleted `explorer-state.json`
before renaming its replacement, so a crash in between lost pins and
recent folders; the settings and session files used the same writer. The
shared writer now flushes the temp file, replaces the target in one rename
step, and retries a busy target instead of deleting it; state reads take
the writers' lock. Fixed in commit `4f774c3` (tested: replace without
leftovers, target never deleted when it cannot be replaced).

### KI-011 - File IDs lost precision crossing to TypeScript (fixed in Step 02)
`file_id` was a JSON number, which JavaScript cannot hold exactly above
2^53. It is now a decimal string on both sides, before tags (Step 11b)
rely on it. Fixed in commit `5cc8df0` (tested with an ID above 2^53).

### KI-012 - A very large Windows Recent folder could delay Home (fixed in Step 02)
Every shortcut was resolved before the 30-item limit applied. Shortcuts are
now sorted by their own time and resolved newest-first until 30 live
targets are found. Fixed in commit `e6074a3` (tested: 5,000 shortcuts, 31
resolved).

### KI-006 - Help center showed no pages in the packaged app (fixed in Step 01b)
The help client sent `language` where the Rust commands expect `lang`, so
every help call failed. Fixed in commit `1f902bd` (argument names aligned;
verified in the packaged app: 6 pages listed and rendered).

### KI-007 - Maximize button rectangle never reached Windows (fixed in Step 01b)
The button's `ref` was never attached, and the new `set_maximize_rect`
command was missing from the isolation allowlist - two silent failures in
a row. Fixed in commit `7362de4`; verified: the maximize area now returns
`HTMAXBUTTON` (9), close/content return `HTCLIENT` (1).

### KI-008 - Hardcoded-text lint false positive on TypeScript generics (fixed in Step 01b)
The lint's JSX-text regex could span from a generic's `>` across ordinary
code and flag it as UI text. Code-like spans are now skipped; the lint
still fails on a planted hardcoded string (probe-tested). Fixed in commit
`7422092`.
